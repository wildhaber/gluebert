                <h3>Shared template engines</h3>
                <p>There are adapters ready for <strong>Handlebars</strong>, <strong>Mustache</strong> or <strong>Twig</strong> Template engines. This way you can share your templates across multiple interpreter if server-side or on-the-fly generated elements.</p>
                <p>You are using another engine? no problem - there is also a simple way to adapt <strong>your own template</strong> engine.</p>

                <h3>Embedded JSON Schema validation</h3>
                <p>You are sending data across your application and want to ensure data consistency without manual tons of manual validation. Generating on-the-fly elements can be validated with a JSON-Schema validator of your choice. We highly recommend <strong>ajv</strong>.</p>

                <h3>ReactiveX for observable data streams</h3>
                <p>Any module in gluebert.js can subscribe to a certain data stream reacting accordingly. Currently gluebert.js is using RxJS behind the scenes.</p>

                <h3>Dynamic import of modules and dependencies</h3>
                <p>Gluebert.js profits from dynamic code splitting and dynamic ESNext import() you only load the components needed in the document. The times are over where you had a huge payload and computation overhead of unused stylesheets, javascript files or other dependencies. Gluebert automatically loads and binds, when a component requests it.</p>

                <h3>Adaptive to any System</h3>
                <p>You don't need to change your current ecosystem. The only dependency is a proper Webpack workflow for code splitting enabling dynamic imports. So it can be used in any Smyfony-, Drupal-, WordPress-, Hugo-, Jekyll-Project or any other environment you have. Only for Single-Page-Applications you should stay within the framework of your choice.</p>

                <h3>Reusable Modules</h3>
                <p>Similarly to the concept of webcomponents modules you create are fully reusable across multiple projects. This stops you from re-inventing the wheels over and over again.</p>

                <h3>Reasonable Browser-Support back to IE11</h3>
                <p>In the modern age, modern browsers like Chrome, Mozilla, Safari are rarely a problem with these kind of technologies.</p>
                <p>Thanks to polyfills gluebert.js is fully supporting wide range of browsers back to InternetExplorer 11 which unfortunately still has a global market share of ~16%.</p>
