        <h2>Underlaying Concepts</h2>

        <h3>Code Splitting and dynamic import</h3>
        <p>Gluebert.js uses the power of code splitting and dynamic import feature for JavaScript, Stylesheets (Sass, less, stylus, whatever) and even HTML Templates including twig, handlebars, mustache or your own template engine.</p>

        <h3>Mutation- and IntersectionObserver</h3>
        <p>MutationObserver are tracking changes in your DOM and lazy binding module signatures and executes them, when an element appears in the viewport using IntersectionObservers.</p>

        <h3>Observable streams by RxJS</h3>
        <p>To organize, sending and receiving Data through your application there are observable streams available provided by [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/).</p>

        <h3>No payload and computation waste</h3>
        <p>The combination of the core concepts makes computation and payload overhead being a thing of the past.</p>

        <h3>Legacy Browser Support back to IE11</h3>
        <p>The aim of Gluebert.js is, to make it simple and intuitive using modern approaches even for legacy and outdated Browsers back to IE11.</p>
